#Dana's portfolio

## https://dana-kulp-portfolio.herokuapp.com/

## Here is a sample of some of the projects that I have worked on while going through the Code 201 Foundations course at Codefellows. This site is, of course, a work in progress and I have prioritized functionality over styling thus far. I plan to revisit the portfolio project in the interim between the end of this class and the start of 401.
